Customer Experience Varies Widely: Ratings range from 1 to 5, with feedback types spread across positive, neutral, and negative—indicating inconsistency in service and satisfaction.

High Delivery Time Impacts Ratings: Orders with longer delivery times often correlate with lower customer ratings and more negative feedback.

Revenue Potential Exists: Several high-value orders suggest a customer base willing to spend more, especially when service quality is satisfactory.

Speed Drives Satisfaction: Reducing delivery times could directly improve ratings and feedback positivity.

Data-Driven Strategies Work: Regular tracking of KPIs like order value, ratings, and delivery time is essential for targeted improvements and growth.
